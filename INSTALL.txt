In order to install and build our system, you should first 
unzip the project folder somewhere you can navigate to in the terminal. 
You can then navigate to the project folder [expense_tracker], where you will need to first install
the OCaml Graphics library. You can do this by typing in the terminal \
"opam install graphics". Then all you need to do is type "dune exec bin/main.exe" 
and enjoy!
